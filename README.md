# Product Line Performance ‚Äì Tableau BI Project

![Header](/images/highest-performance-sales.png)

### Overview
This project analyzes **The Paper Company‚Äôs** performance across its newer **non-paper office supply product lines**.  
As a Data Analyst, I was tasked to explore 12 months of sales data from **3 regions** and **11 sales reps**, and provide insights and recommendations for **Angela**, the Head of Finance.

The goal: identify which product lines and regions drive the most revenue, detect performance issues, and uncover improvement opportunities.

### Objectives & KPIs

| Objective | Description | KPI |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| Review current product lines and identify areas for improvement | Track top-performing products, regions, and reps | Revenue |
| Identify areas that can improve revenue | Understand variance in sales volume and pricing | Units |
| Monitor pricing and operational consistency | Detect pricing anomalies between regions | Unit Price |

** KPI Definitions**

- **Revenue** = Units √ó Unit Price  
- **Units** = Total quantity sold  
- **Unit Price** = Average sale price per unit  

---

### Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äì Office Supplies Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **File:** `/data/OfficeSupplies.csv`
- **Rows:** 3,960 records  
- **Columns:** `Order Date`, `Region`, `Rep`, `Item`, `Units`, `Unit Price`  
- **Period Covered:** 12 months  

A quick validation script (`notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb`) checks for missing values, duplicates, and verifies calculated revenue consistency.

---

### Data Exploration (Python)
Before visualization, I performed a short data quality check in Python (Pandas).

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data/OfficeSupplies.csv')
df.info()
df.describe()
df.isna().sum()
df['Revenue'] = df['Units'] * df['Unit Price']
```
---

## Observations:

No missing data detected.
Revenue formula consistent with provided values.
Some outlier pricing in ‚ÄúBinders‚Äù category, possibly from regional promotions.

---

## Dashboard Design ‚Äì Z Layout

The Tableau dashboard follows a Z-pattern layout for clear data storytelling:

- **Summary KPIs ‚Äì Revenue, Units, and Unit Price
- **Revenue Trends by Region ‚Äì monthly performance
- **Heatmap of Product Revenue ‚Äì identify top-selling items
- **Sales Rep Scatter Plot ‚Äì performance outliers and quartiles

Average Unit Price Comparison ‚Äì pricing consistency across regions

## Key Visuals
1. High-Level KPIs
2. Revenue Trend by Region
3. Revenue by Item (Heatmap)
4. Revenue by Sales Rep (Scatter Plot)
5. Unit Price by Region

## Insights & Recommendations
| **Area** | **Insight** | **Recommendation** |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Regional Performance** | The North Region consistently outperforms others but shows the widest unit price variance. | Review pricing policy and apply standardized pricing or discounts based on margins. |
| **Sales Team** | 2 reps (Julia & Frank) generate 35% of total revenue; 3 reps underperform. | Provide targeted sales training and reassign territories. |
| **Product Lines** | Binders and Staplers show declining revenue trends despite stable unit prices. | Consider limited-time promotions or bundling strategies. |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Average Unit Price varies 15‚Äì20% between regions. | Audit regional pricing and evaluate competitive benchmarks. |
